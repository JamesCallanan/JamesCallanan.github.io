# Integrating feature attribution methods into the loss function of deep learning classifiers

- IMVIP 2022 short [paper](https://jamescallanan.github.io/assets/ShortPaper.pdf)
- Project [code](https://github.com/JamesCallanan/Grad-CAM)
- IMVIP 2022 [poster](https://jamescallanan.github.io/assets/Poster.pdf)

The images used in the poster differ from the images used in the experiment referenced in the short paper and thesis. I decided to do this as I wanted the essence of the heatmap loss function to be communicable from a ~30 second glance.

- Master's [thesis](https://jamescallanan.github.io/assets/Thesis.pdf)

  The discussion section of the thesis contains more information on applications and future directions of heatmap loss functions. I would recommend skipping thesis pages [12-18] as they were word count fillers!
